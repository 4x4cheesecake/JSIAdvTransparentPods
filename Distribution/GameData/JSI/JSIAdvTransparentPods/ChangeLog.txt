V0.1.4.0
Added swappable/multiple Depth Mask Shader support. See the WIKI page for details.
Automatically enable/disable the TransparentPod setting (part right click menu) if the IVA is obstructed by something else in front of it.
TransparentPod setting in the part right click menu will now display "Obstructed" in this scenario ONLY if it was set to "ON". If it is set to
"OFF" or "AUTO" it will remain locked in that state whilst obstructed.
Improved Portrait Camera handling.
V0.1.3.0 (now released as a seperate mod/repro from Raster Prop Monitor)
Fixed broken Transparent Shader and Opaque Shader swapping functionality.
Fixed camera jitters/lag on Transparent IVAs that are not part of the active vessel in flight.
Fixed Portrait Cameras when EVA from vessel.
Fixed ON/OFF/AUTO functionality in the Editor.
Opened settings var LoadedInactive to public so other mods can get it if they want it.
Public bool isIVAobstructed added to JSIAdvTransparentPod will be true if IVA attached to part is obstructed by another object in the foreground.
V0.1.2.0 (released under RPM V0.25.x)
Lots of bug fixes. Fix issues with portrait camera processing.
Fix bugs with settings file. Settings file now changed to default to show transparent pods on all loaded parts, and fixed logic for
processing.
V0.1.1.0 (released under RPM V0.25.0)
JSITransparentPod is now obsolete (sorry for the short notice). Support for it has been removed from RasterPropMonitor. 
To replace it, JSIAdvTransparentPod, in its own DLL, is now included in the RPM distribution. 
The new module takes advantage of the stock cutaway functionality.
